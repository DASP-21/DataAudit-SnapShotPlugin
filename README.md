The **Data Audit and Snapshot Plugin** (DASP) is a **Node.js** application that provides an easy to use, web-based utility to study the genealogy of data as it gets created, stored, modified, deleted and analysed on a recurring basis.

## ðŸ’­ About The Service
DASP plugin exposes simple HTTP endpoints to register client's data items and captures changes on data item over time. The client can register the data item and view all changes on it. The clients have the option to either view all the changes made to their data or be able to view the audit history for the same, based on the time stamp.
* It also includes the ability to add a filter to view the capture history based on categories. 
* The plugin also supports toggle functionality to enable/disable CDC on specific items based on the **data category** (`user defined entity classification`) or based on the **unique ID** for a specific data item.

  * Make a `POST` request to register it onto our service. 
    ```
    /api/createlog
    ```
  * Once client's data item is registered, it can be identified by a **data_id** which is unique for every data item registered on DASP.

   * Make a `GET` request to our service with the **data_id**.
        ```
        /api/getlog/:data_id
        ```
   
   * ![Get Current State of Client's Data](./assets/getlog_dataid.gif "Get Current State of Client's Data")
